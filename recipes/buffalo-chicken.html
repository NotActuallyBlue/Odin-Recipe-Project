            <p>This Buffalo chicken mac and cheese recipe was first introduced to me at my local ballpark, and I thought it was a great idea! This is what I whipped up. Serve with celery sticks and beer. Let me know what you think.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
                    <li>1 rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3 cups milk</li>
                    <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
                    <li>½ cup hot sauce (such as Frank's® Redhot®), or more to taste</li>
                    <li>½ cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
                </ul>
            <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Making the <em>beer batter</em>: Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Blend beer and egg in a separate bowl, then quickly stir into flour mixture until combined with a few lumps remaining.</li>
                    <li>Making the <em>white sauce</em>: Mix together yogurt and mayonnaise in a medium bowl. Gradually stir in fresh lime juice until consistency is slightly runny. Season with jalapeño, capers, cayenne, oregano, cumin, and dill.</li>
                    <li>Start fish tacos: Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Dust fish pieces lightly with flour. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Dip floured fish pieces into beer batter. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Fry in hot oil until crisp and golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Lightly fry tortillas in hot oil until just crisped, but not too crisp. Drain on paper towels.</li>
                    <li>Place fried fish in tortillas; top with shredded cabbage and white sauce.</li>
                </ol>
